      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is an open source distributed version control system. Git is essentially a content tracker. Content can be stored by Git and the code which is stored keeps changing as more code is added. This allows a full history of what changes have happened with the project. Git also has a remote repository which allows the full copy of the code to be on every participants' computers. We need source code Version Control System because it is often the case that multiple people are working on the same project at the same time. Git ensures that there is no code conflicts between people and that the history of which each person added or deleted is mantained.

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project â€“ multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>1) A local repo is a repository used in Git that is on your device and is only for you. The local repo will have all of the files you used and the commit history allowing you to see all code changes throughout the project </p>
      <p>2) A remote repo is a repostory used in Git that allows one to work with others on the same project. For this repo, the code is on a central server which is shared by the people working on the project. Because of the remote repo, people on the project need to retrieve files and then commit to it.  </p>
      <p>3) To start using Git in a team project, first, a member of the team must create the remote repo where all files will be comitted. Then, each team member must clone this repo so that they have access to all team members' changes and commits. Then, members can make changes by writing code and committing regularly, using informative commit messages. Now that you have made changes locally, you must push the changes so that other team members can see and use the new code. To start working on the project again, you must first pull down other team members' changes so that the code is up to date when you begin working on it.
